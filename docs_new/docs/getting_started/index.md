## Getting Started

To start collecting data in Tracardi, you need to set up the system, integrate it with your website or application, and configure event sources and event tracking. Here's a step-by-step guide to get you started:


### 1. Install Tracardi

You need to have Tracardi installed and running. This can be done using Docker, Helm, or directly from the source code. Ensure that all necessary components, such as the backend, frontend, and optional modules, are installed.
### 2. Configure Event Sources

Event sources are the points where data enters Tracardi. You need to define these sources in the Tracardi system to start collecting data from them.

    Creating an Event Source: Go to the Tracardi GUI, navigate to Inbound Traffic, and add a new event source. You'll need to provide details such as the name, type, and URL of the event source.

### 3. Integrate Tracardi JavaScript Snippet

To collect data from your website, you need to integrate the Tracardi JavaScript snippet into your web pages.

    Add the JavaScript Snippet:

    html

    <script>
        !function(e){"object"==typeof exports&&"undefined"!=typeof module..
    </script>
    <script>
        const options = {
            tracker: {
                url: {
                    script: 'http://your-tracardi-url/tracker',
                    api: 'http://your-tracardi-url'
                },
                source: {
                    id: "<your-event-source-id>"
                }
            }
        }
    </script>

    Replace your-tracardi-url with the URL of your Tracardi API server and your-event-source-id with the ID of your event source.

### 4. Send Events via JavaScript

Define and send events from your web pages using JavaScript. Events can represent various user actions such as page views, clicks, form submissions, etc.

    Example of Sending Events:

    javascript

    window.tracker.track("page-view", {"url": window.location.href, "title": document.title});
    window.tracker.track("button-click", {"button-id": "subscribe-button"});

### 5. Verify Integration

After adding the JavaScript code and sending events, verify that the data is being collected properly in Tracardi.

    Check Event Data: Navigate to the Tracardi GUI and check the Events section to see if the events from your web pages are being captured.

### 6. Configure Workflows

Workflows define how events are processed in Tracardi. You can set up workflows to analyze and act on the collected data.

    Create Workflows: Go to the Processing section, create a new workflow, and define the nodes and actions based on your requirements.

Additional Features and Configurations

    Link Tracking: Track user interactions with links using the Inbound Traffic/Event Redirects feature.
    Real-time Processing: Send events immediately by setting the fire parameter to true in your JavaScript code.
    Event Context: Extend event information by defining context data such as browser metadata and system variables.
