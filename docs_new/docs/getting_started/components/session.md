### Session

In Tracardi, a session is a type of data that is often associated with a visit to a website or application. It is a
period during which a user actively interacts with the system or application. As long as the session remains unchanged,
the visit is considered ongoing. The session ID is set when data is sent to Tracardi, and it is typically under the
control of the client program.

#### Components of a Session

1. **Session ID**: Each session has a unique identifier that distinguishes it from other sessions.
2. **User Profile**: Sessions are linked to user profiles, which contain detailed information about the user. This
   linkage helps in associating session activities with the user’s overall behavior and characteristics.
3. **Start Time**: Sessions have defined start time, and a sequence of events.
4. **Events**: Sessions contain events that record user interactions and activities during the session. Events can
   include page views, clicks, form submissions, and other user actions.
5. **Context Data**: Sessions often contain data about the context in which an event was launched, such as the type of
   device, operating system, or other characteristics of the user's environment.

### Importance of Sessions

- **User Tracking**: Sessions help in tracking user interactions over a period, providing insights into user behavior
  and engagement.
- **Behavior Analysis**: By analyzing session data, you can understand user behavior patterns, such as how long users
  stay on your site, what actions they perform, and what content they engage with.
- **Marketing and Analytics**: Sessions provide valuable data for marketing campaigns origin, helping you measure the
  effectiveness of your strategies and optimize user engagement.

### Session Management

In Tracardi, sessions are automatically created and managed. Here’s how session management typically works:

1. **Session Initiation**: A session starts when a user begins interacting with your website or application. This can be
   triggered by various events, such as loading a page or performing an action.
2. **Event Recording**: Throughout the session, events are recorded to capture user interactions. These events are
   associated with the session ID.
3. **Session Termination**: A session ends when the user becomes inactive for a certain period or explicitly logs out.
   The session’s end time is recorded, and the session is then closed which is indicated with event `Visit Ended`.
