# Integration

Integration in Tracardi refers to the process of connecting external systems, websites, and databases to Tracardi,
enabling data exchange and interaction. This process ensures that data from various sources can be collected, and
processed.

## Integration Types

1. **[Javascript](js/index.md)**:
    - Integration allows for the automatic ingestion of data from external sources into Tracardi. This can include user
      interactions, transactional data, and other relevant events captured from websites, mobile apps, CRM systems, and
      other databases.

2. **[API Calls](api/api-integration.md)**:
    - Tracardi supports integration with external systems through APIs. This involves setting up API endpoints to
      receive data from third-party applications or to send processed data and insights back to these applications.

3. **[Redirect Links](redirect/index.md)**:
    - Integration involves defining event sources within Tracardi. Event sources are configurations that specify how and
      from where data is collected. Examples include webhooks, REST APIs, and direct database connections.
